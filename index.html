                The field of web development has evolved significantly, transitioning from static information websites to dynamic and interactive platforms driven by user-generated content. 
                This shift has not only created new business opportunities but also transformed the way people interact with each other online. 
                
                In this course, CITS3403/5505 Agile Web Development, students will delve into the technologies, programming languages, and environments that form the backbone of modern Internet development.
                The course covers the fundamentals of the web and the Internet, exploring key browser technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                Students will learn about the development process for building large-scale web applications and gain hands-on experience with full-stack web development using technologies like Flask, AJAX, and SQLite.

                Overall, this course aims to equip students with the necessary skills to understand and leverage the technologies that power the modern web. 
                By blending theoretical knowledge with practical application, students will be able to develop and showcase their abilities in building dynamic, interactive, and agile web solutions.

            At the conclusion of the unit, I found the group project to be a valuable experience as it provided insights into agile processes and the importance of teamwork in web development. 
            However, to enhance the learning experience, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into coding topics. 
            I would highly recommend this unit to other students who are interested in web development or have prior experience in the field.
