            <p>
                The field of web development has evolved significantly, transitioning from static information websites to dynamic and interactive platforms driven by user-generated content. 
                This shift has not only created new business opportunities but also transformed the way people interact with each other online. 
                
                In this course, CITS3403/5505 Agile Web Development, students will delve into the technologies, programming languages, and environments that form the backbone of modern Internet development.
                The course covers the fundamentals of the web and the Internet, exploring key browser technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                Students will learn about the development process for building large-scale web applications and gain hands-on experience with full-stack web development using technologies like Flask, AJAX, and SQLite.

                Overall, this course aims to equip students with the necessary skills to understand and leverage the technologies that power the modern web. 
                By blending theoretical knowledge with practical application, students will be able to develop and showcase their abilities in building dynamic, interactive, and agile web solutions.

It has six characteristics: statelessness, client-server architecture, uniform interface, cacheability, layered system, and code on demand. In a Flask project, adhering to these characteristics is significant for effective deployment. Statelessness allows scalability and reliability, as each request contains all necessary information. The client-server architecture enables separation of concerns and flexibility. A uniform interface ensures interoperability and simplifies client development. Cacheability enhances performance by allowing caching responses. Layered systems support scalability and modularity. Code on demand allows the server to send executable code to clients, facilitating extensibility. By following these REST principles, Flask projects can achieve improved scalability, performance, and maintainability.</textarea>
